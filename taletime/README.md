# TaleTime

Children may discover a novel way to listen to audiobooks with the help of the revolutionary Android and iOS software TaleTime.

In addition to offering parents the chance to record the stories themselves, we also provide professionally recorded audiobooks. Recording is incredibly practical and, naturally, is something that anyone with a little understanding of technology can perform. Children at TaleTime can also decide how the stories will develop on their own.
