  # FIXME remove this version override when possible
  # Unfortunately, marquee package uses fading_edge_scrollview in version 3 which is incompatible
  # with flutter version 3.22. Until marquee is updated to use the newer version of fading_edge,
  # we have to include this manual version override.
